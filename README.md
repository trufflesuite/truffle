Truffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. With Truffle you get:

- Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
- Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.
- Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.
- Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.
- Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
- Interactive console for direct contract communication.
- Instant rebuilding of assets during development.
- External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

### Install

```
$ npm install -g truffle
```

_Note: To avoid any strange permissions errors, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)._

### Quick Usage

For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

```
$ truffle init
```

From there, you can run `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.

Truffle comes bundled with a local development blockchain server that launches automatically when you invoke the commands above. If you'd like to [configure a more advanced development environment](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration) we recommend you install the blockchain server separately by running `npm install -g ganache` at the command line.

- [ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache): a command-line version of Truffle's blockchain server.
- [ganache-ui](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-ui): A GUI for the server that displays your transaction history and chain state.
