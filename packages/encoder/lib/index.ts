/**
 * # Truffle Encoder
 *
 * This module provides an interface for recognizing JavaScript user input of
 * Solidity values, encoding those values for use in a transaction, and performing
 * overload resolution based on those values to determine which Solidity method to
 * encode for.
 *
 * The interface is split into three classes: The project encoder, the contract
 * encoder, and the contract instance encoder.  The project encoder is associated
 * to the project as a whole; it can recognize user input, encode transactions,
 * and resolve overloads, although the interface for the latter two is somewhat
 * inconvenient.  The contract encoder is associated to a specific contract class.
 * It is similar to the project encoder, but presents an easier-to-use interface
 * for transaction encoding and overload resolution, so long as one is dealing
 * with methods of the specified class.  The contract instance encoder is
 * associated to a specific contract instance; it is like the contract encoder,
 * but is associated to a specific address, allowing the `to` option in
 * transactions to be populated automatically.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ### Initialization
 *
 * Create a encoder with one of the various constructor functions.
 *
 * For a project encoder, use the [[forProject|`forProject`]] function.
 *
 * For a contract encoder, use the [[forArtifact|`forArtifact`]] or
 * [[forContract|`forContract`]] function.
 *
 * For a contract instance encoder, use one of the following:
 * * [[forDeployedArtifact|`forDeployedArtifact`]]
 * * [[forDeployedContract|`forDeployedContract`]]
 * * [[forArtifactAt|`forArtifactAt`]]
 * * [[forContractAt|`forContractAt`]]
 * * [[forContractInstance|`forContractInstance`]]
 *
 * See the documentation of these functions for details, or below for usage
 * examples.
 *
 * All of these functions take a final argument in which information about the
 * project is specified; currently only a few methods for specifying project
 * information are allowed, but more are planned.
 *
 * One can also spawn encoders from other encoders by supplying additional
 * information.  See the documentation for the individual encoder classes for a
 * method listing.
 *
 * ### Encoder methods
 *
 * See the documentation for the individual encoder classes for a method listing.
 *
 * ### Wrapped format information
 *
 * When using the various "wrap" functions, values will be wrapped in
 * machine-readable [[Format.Values.Value]] objects containing individual wrapped
 * values.  (This is the same format that `@truffle/decoder` produces output in.)
 * See the [[Format|format documentation]] for an overview and complete module
 * listing.
 *
 * ### Use of project information and encoding of enums
 *
 * The encoder can do purely ABI-based encoding, like other encoders; however it
 * has the capability to use project information to do more.
 *
 * The most significant use of this is that if further project information is
 * present, this allows for enums to be entered as strings with the name of
 * the option, rather than having to be entered via the underlying number.
 * See the documentation of [[ProjectEncoder.wrap]] for more.
 *
 * Similarly, if project information is present, the encoder will also throw an
 * error if you attempt to put an out-of-range value into an enum type, and
 * refuse to consider overloads that would result in this during overload
 * resolution.  If project information is absent, the encoder will be unable to
 * recognize any error in these situations.
 *
 * ### ENS resolution
 *
 * The encoder supports ENS resolution for address and contract types if
 * initialized to support such.  See the documentation of the [[EncoderSettings]]
 * and [[EnsSettings]] types for more.
 *
 * ### Basic usage examples
 *
 * These usage examples are for a project with two contracts, `Contract1` and
 * `Contract2`.  Let's suppose these look like the following:
 *
 * ```solidity
 *pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
 *
 *contract Contract1 {
 *  function enumExample(Contract2.Ternary x) public payable {
 *  }
 *
 *  function overloaded(uint x) public payable {
 *  }
 *
 *  function overloaded(string x) public payable {
 *  }
 *}
 *
 *contract Contract2 {
 *  enum Ternary { No, Yes, Maybe }
 *}
 * ```
 *
 * #### Encoding a transaction
 *
 * ```typescript
 *import { forContract } from "@truffle/encoder";
 *const contract1 = artifacts.require("Contract1");
 *const contract2 = artifacts.require("Contract2");
 *const encoder = await Encoder.forContract(Contract1, [Contract1, Contract2]);
 *const abi = Contract1.abi.find(abiEntry => abiEntry.name === "enumExample");
 *const tx = await encoder.encodeTransaction(
 *  abi,
 *  ["Maybe", { value: 1 }],
 *  { allowOptions: true }
 *);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Performing overload resolution
 *
 * ```typescript
 *import { forContract } from "@truffle/encoder";
 *const contract1 = artifacts.require("Contract1");
 *const contract2 = artifacts.require("Contract2");
 *const encoder = await Encoder.forContract(Contract1, [Contract1, Contract2]);
 *const abis = Contract1.abi.filter(abiEntry => abiEntry.name === "overloaded");
 *const { tx, abi } = await encoder.encodeTransaction(
 *  abis,
 *  ["hello", { value: 1 }],
 *  { allowOptions: true }
 *);
 * ```
