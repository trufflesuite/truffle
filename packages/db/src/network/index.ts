   * identifies blockchain networks as

   * utilizes a system of

   * particular blockchain while respecting that networks may hard-fork or
   * re-organize in the future.**
   *
   * To complete these linkages, this method alternately queries @truffle/db
   * for candidate ancestors/descendants and fetches actual records from the
   * connected blockchain itself until it finds an optimal match.
   * This process operates in logarithmic time and logarithmic space based on
   * the number of existing known blocks in the system and the number of blocks
   * provided as input.
   *
   * **Note**: Despite optimizing for speed and memory usage, this process can
   * nonetheless still perform a significant number of network requests and
   * internal database reads. Although this system has been tested to perform
   * satisfactorily against tens of thousands of blocks with multiple hardfork
   * scenarios, this abstraction provides a few [[IncludeSettings]] to migitate
   * unforeseen issues.
   *
   * This returns an [[IdObject]] for each [[DataModel.Network]] resource added
   * in the process. Return values are ordered so that indexes of returned IDs
   * correspond to indexes of provided blocks; any blocks that fail to load
   * successfully will correspond to values of `null` or `undefined` in the
   * resulting array.
