// March 14, 2019 - Mike Seese:
// This shim was intended to be temporary (see the above comment)
// with the idea of a more robust implementation. That implementation
// would essentially take this shim and include it under the
// ethereum/apis/web3 (or something like that) structure.
// I chose to extend/inherit web3 here to keep scope minimal for
// getting web3 to behave with Quorum and AxCore (future/concurrent PR).
// I wanted to do as little changing to the original Truffle codebase, and
// for it to still expect a web3 instance. Otherwise, the scope of these
// quick support work would be high. The "Web3Shim" is a shim for only
// web3.js, and it was not intended to serve as the general purpose
// truffle <=> all DLTs adapter. We have other commitments currently that
// should drive the development of the correct architecture of
// `@truffle/interface-adapter`that should use this work in a more
// sane and organized manner.
