NewTruffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for NewChain, forked originally from truffle. With NewTruffle, you get:

* Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
* Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.
* Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.
* Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.
* Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
* Interactive console for direct contract communication.
* Instant rebuilding of assets during development.
* External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

### Install

```
$ npm install -g newtruffle
```

### Quick Usage

For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

```
$ newtruffle init
```

From there, you can run `newtruffle compile`, `newtruffle migrate` and `newtruffle test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.
